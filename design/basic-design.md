# BASIC WEB DESIGN

Notes from [Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3](https://www.udemy.com/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/)

## TYPOGRAPHY

1. Use a font-size between 15 - 25 pixels.

2. Use (really) big font-sizes for headlines. There are no real size limits. Some go for 60-90 pixels. If you have a huge font-size, you may want to decrease the font-weight so that the headline doesn't steal all attention away from the other elements on the page.

3. Use line-spacing, which is the vertical spacing between lines, to make text easier to read. Keep it between 120% - 150%.

4. 45 - 90 characters per line is the optimal line length for easier reads.

5. Use good fonts.

### HOW TO **CHOOSE** A FONT?

1. Choose a font which reflects the look and feel you want for your website.

2. Decide: sans-serif of serif typeface?

3. Use a good font.

4. Use only that one typeface (most of the time).

## COLORS

1. Use only one base color.
  * [Flat UI Colors](https://flatuicolors.com/)

2. Use a tool if you want to use more colors.
  * [Adobe Color Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create)
  * [Paletton](https://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF)

3. Use color to draw attention.
  * Call to Action butons.

4. Never use black in your design.

5. Choose colors wisely.
  * Red is a great color to use when power, passion, strength and excitement want to be transmitted. Brighter tones are more energetic and darker shades are more powerful and elegant.
  * Orange draws attention without being as overpowering as red. It means cheerfulness and creativity. Orange can be associated with friendliness, confidence, and courage.
  * Yellow is energetic and gives the feeling of happiness and liveliness. Also, it associates with curiosity, intelligence, brightness, etc.
  Green is the color of harmony, nature, life and health. Also, it is often associated with money. In design, green can have a balancing and harmonizing effect.
  * Blue means patience, peace, trustworthiness, and stability. It is one of the most beloved colors, especially by men. It is associated with professionalism, trust and honor. That's actually why the biggest social networks use blue.
  * Purple is traditionally associated with power, nobility and wealth. In your design, purple can give a sense of wisdom, royalty, nobility, luxury, and mystery.
  * Pink expresses romance, passivity, care, peace, affection, etc.
  * Brown is the color of relaxation and confidence. Brown means earthiness, nature, durability, comfort, and reliability.

## WORKING WITH IMAGES

1. Put text directly on the image.
  * This works best when your image is darker and your text is lighter. Otherwise, you will not have enough contrast. 

2. Overlay the image.
  * Using black is the easiest
  * Using color gradient can achieve stunning effects.

3. Put your text in a box.
  * The box should be opaque so you can still see the image underneath it. You can make the box black or go with some other color.

4. Blur the image.
  * You can blue the whole image or you can use an out-of-focus area.

5. The floor fade
  * A technique where the image fades to black at the bottom with white text written over it. It increases the text's readability dramatrically.

## WORKING WITH ICONS

1. Use icons to list features/steps.

2. Use icons for actions and links.
  * Icons should be instantaneously recognizable.
  * Label your icons.

3. Icons should not take a center stage. 
  * Icons should not infest your webpage.

4. Use icon fonts whenever possible. 

## SPACING AND LAYOUT

You have to be using whitespace strategically. It makes your website look clean,modern, and inviting.

1. Use whitespace.
  * Put whitespace between your elements.
  * Put whitespace between your groups of elements.
  * Put whitepsace between your website's sections.
  * But don't exaggerate. You may make your content lose relationship between one another.

2. Define hierarchy (visually).
  * Whitespace describes invisible relationships between the elements of your website.
  * Define where you want your audience to look first.
  * Establish a flow that corresponds to your content's message.
  * Use whitespace to build that flow.

## INTRODUCTION TO USER EXPERIENCE (UX for the fancy)

**User interface** is the presentation of a product, how it looks and feels.

**User experience** is the overall experience the use has with a product. 

> It's not just what it looks like and feels like.
> Design is how it works.
> -<cite>Steve Jobs</cite>

User other websites as inspiration to see what other leading designers are **doing right**. 

* Collect designs that you like.
* Try to understand everything about them.
* Why do they look good?
* What do these sites have in common?
* How were they built in HTML and CSS?

**Steal** like an artist. When you're starting out, don't worry about being original. Get inspiration first. When you've gained more experience then originality will come to you.

## Summary
* Most of your content will be text, so beautiful typography is a key element to a good looking website.
* Images are getting more and more important in webdesign, so choosing great images and putting text on them is an essential part of your work.
* Icons are also a good way of setting a friendly tone for your website, but use them carefully.
* The adequate use of whitespace makes a website look professionally designed, so use it a lot, but in the correct way.
* Build a layout by defining the visual hierarchy of your content. Whitespace is also important for this.
* Your website should be designed in a way that ensures that both the user and the owner of the website achieve their goals. This is the user experience.

# MODEM VS ROUTER - WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

Notes from [Powercert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mad4kQ5835Y)

## MODEM

A modem is what brings the internet into your home or business. It maintains a connection to your ISP.

A computer only reads digital signals and the internet only reads analog signals.

The modem *demodulates* incoming analogy signals into a digital signal.

The modem also *modulates* outing digital signals into an analog signal.

Modem means **mo**dulator/**dem**odulator.

## MODEM VS ROUTER

A router is what routes or passes your internet connection to all your devices.

If you only have one device then theoretically you only need a modem and not a router. But that's rarely the case.

Some devices are a combination of a modem AND router.

# SSL, TLS, HTTP, HTTPS Explained 

Notes from [Powercert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hExRDVZHhig)

## HTTP

HTTP stands for Hyper text transfer protocol. It is the protocol that is used for viewing web pages. In standard HTTP, all information is sent in clear text. 

- Vulnerable to hackers

## HTTPS

HTTPS is HTTP with a secure feature. It encrypts data that is being retrieved by HTTP.

## SSL 

SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer. It's a protocol used to ensure security on the internet.

It uses public key encryption to secure data.

## TLS

TLS stands for Transport Layer Security. It is the latest industry standard cryptographic protocol. It is the successor to SSL. It authenticates the server, client, and encrypts the data.

A lot of websites are now using HTTPS by default, regardless if sensitive data is going to be exchanged or not. Why?

Google is flagging websites as "not secure" if they are not SSL protected.

Google is penalizing websites that are not SSL protected in search rankings.

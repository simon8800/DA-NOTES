# Hub, Switch, & Router Explained - What's the difference?

Notes from [Powercert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1z0ULvg_pW8)

A hub, switch, and router all similar but there are differences in how they handle data.

## HUB

The purpose of a hub is to connect all your network devices together on an internal network. It has multiple ports that accepts ethernet connections from devices.

They do not filter data and do not know which connection to send data to. What ends up happening is that it send the data to all connected devices.

This creates security concerns and uneccessary network traffic.

## SWITCH

A switch is intelligent. It can learn the physical addresses (MAC Address). It will direct data only to the intended destination port.

This reduces both security concerns and traffic flow. They are far more preffered over hubs.

**Hubs** and **Switches** are used to exchange data within a local area network.

Not used to exchange data outside their own network. They do not read IP addresses.

## ROUTER

A router routes data from one network to another based on their IP addresses. The router is the gateway of a network.

Hubs and Switches are used to create networks. Routers are used to connect networks.

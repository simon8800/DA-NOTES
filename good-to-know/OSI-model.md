## OSI Model

The OSI Model is a theoretical stack of seven layers that can be used a reference to help understand how networks operate. It standardized networks that allows mutli-vendor systems.

Prior to this, devices from one vendor could not communicate with another network. 

## LAYERS

7. Application - SMTP, FTP, Telnet
6. Presentation - Format Data, Encryption
5. Session - Start and Stop Sessions between devices
4. Transport - TCP, UDP, Port Numbers
3. Network - IP Address, Routers
2. Data Link - MAC Address, Switches
1. Physical - Cable Network Interface Cards, Hubs

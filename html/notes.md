# HTML NOTES

## SPAN
Use the span tag to style specifc words inside another element. Spans are good since they are in-line elements and won't affect the things around it.


## GLYPHS
You can add special characters in your HTML by using these [glyphs](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/html/glyphs/).

```html
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- this creates a whitespace in the p tag. -->
```
